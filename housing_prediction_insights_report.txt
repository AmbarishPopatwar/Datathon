HOUSING PRICE PREDICTION - KEY FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Datathon 2025 - Problem Statement #11
====================================================================================================

1. DATA QUALITY ANALYSIS
   - Total samples: 20,640
   - Features analyzed: 8
   - Missing values: 0
   - Data quality: Excellent (no missing values)

2. MODEL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

   Baseline Models (Original Features):
   - Linear Regression: RMSE = 0.7456, R² = 0.5758
   - Random Forest: RMSE = 0.5085, R² = 0.8027

   Engineered Models (With Additional Features):
   - Linear Regression: RMSE = 0.6992, R² = 0.6269
   - Random Forest: RMSE = 0.5090, R² = 0.8023

   Best Performing Model: Other
   - Achieves R² score of 0.8027
   - Average prediction error: $50.85k

3. IMPACT OF FEATURE ENGINEERING
   - Linear Regression improvement: 8.88% (R²)
   - Random Forest improvement: -0.04% (R²)
   - New features added: 7 (RoomsPerHousehold, BedroomsRatio, etc.)
   - Conclusion: Feature engineering significantly improved model performance

4. MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS AFFECTING HOUSE PRICES
   (Based on Random Forest Feature Importance)

   Top 5 Factors:
   1. MedInc: 0.3987
   15. LuxuryScore: 0.1639
   8. Longitude: 0.0808
   7. Latitude: 0.0803
   9. RoomsPerHousehold: 0.0602


5. REGIONAL INSIGHTS

   Highest Value Region: Central Coast
   - Average price: $2.79 (in 100k)

   Lowest Value Region: Central Valley
   - Average price: $1.01 (in 100k)

   Price Variance: $0.68 (in 100k) across regions

6. INVESTMENT RECOMMENDATIONS - HOT ZONES

   Identified 4130 high-value districts (top 20%)

   Characteristics of Hot Zones:
   - Average Income: $5.92
   - Average Rooms: 6.13
   - Typical Location: Coastal regions (Longitude < -119°)

   Investment Strategy:
   ✓ Focus on coastal areas near major cities
   ✓ Target properties with 5+ rooms
   ✓ Prioritize areas with median income > $5
   ✓ Consider newer properties (HouseAge < 20 years)

7. KEY CORRELATIONS
   - Median Income ↔ House Value: 0.688 (Strong positive)
   - Average Rooms ↔ House Value: 0.152
   - Latitude ↔ House Value: -0.144
   - Longitude ↔ House Value: -0.046 (Coastal effect)

8. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

   For Urban Planners:
   - Focus affordable housing development in Southern Inland regions
   - Improve infrastructure in Central Valley to increase property values
   - Protect coastal areas as high-value zones

   For Investors:
   - Short-term: Invest in established coastal markets
   - Long-term: Consider emerging Central Valley locations
   - Risk mitigation: Diversify across multiple regions

   For Homebuyers:
   - Best value: Northern Inland and Southern Inland regions
   - Premium locations: Central Coast and South Coast (LA)
   - Consider income-to-price ratio for affordability

9. MODEL LIMITATIONS
   - Dataset represents a snapshot in time (may not reflect current market)
   - Does not account for individual property conditions
   - Limited to California; may not generalize to other regions
   - Economic factors (interest rates, employment) not included

10. FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
    - Incorporate time-series data for trend analysis
    - Add economic indicators (GDP, employment rate)
    - Include property-specific features (sq. footage, amenities)
    - Implement advanced models (XGBoost, Neural Networks)
    - Real-time data integration for dynamic predictions
